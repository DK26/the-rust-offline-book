# Introduction

This book will guide you through the steps needed to create and establish a working
development environment for Rust in offline conditions such as working with standalone machines or working from within offline, no-internet networks.

The book's main focus is on manual preparation and all that is required to create such a Rust ready,  offline environment, but it will also include other automated solutions for completion.

Also, it is my hope that the book will become a central place on the topic where discussion can be made and recorded on the topic.

This book, while aiming to support all platforms, is mainly written by me at this time for the Windows environment as Windows is used and found more often within big organizations, which are the first ones that would probably find interest in such a book.

> **AUTHOR NOTES**:  
> As I write this book, I am also learning what could be the simplest most effective way to achieve the goal of having to run an offline Rust environment. At this stage, it is very likely to change often. In fact, currently I find the tool `romt` to be most efficient for the job and consider building the first manuals on top of it. Although `romt` introduce its own very detailed manuals, it is my goal to bring forth the most basic and important essence for achieving this.
